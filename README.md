# ML_2305656

This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms developed as part of an academic machine learning course. The project focuses on understanding core concepts such as regression, classification, and optimization techniques through hands-on coding and experimentation.

The implementations include both from-scratch approaches and library-based methods for comparison and learning purposes.
